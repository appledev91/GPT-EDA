**Key Insights**

* The data shows a strong positive correlation between life expectancy and GDP per capita, indicating that countries with higher GDP per capita tend to have higher life expectancies.
* The data shows a strong negative correlation between population and GDP per capita, indicating that countries with larger populations tend to have lower GDP per capita.
* The distribution of life expectancy is skewed to the right, with a mean of 59.48 years and a median of 60.77 years. This indicates that there are more countries with lower life expectancies than countries with higher life expectancies.
* The distribution of population is skewed to the right, with a mean of 296,012,142 and a median of 70,235,960. This indicates that there are more countries with smaller populations than countries with larger populations.
* The distribution of GDP per capita is skewed to the right, with a mean of 7,211.03 and a median of 3,530.69. This indicates that there are more countries with lower GDP per capita than countries with higher GDP per capita.
